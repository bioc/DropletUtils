Description: Provides a number of utility functions for handling 
    single-cell (RNA-seq) data from droplet technologies such as 10X
    Genomics. This includes data loading, identification of cells from 
    empty droplets, removal of barcode-swapped pseudo-cells, and 
    downsampling of the count matrix.
